The Department of Mathematics at the University of Exeter is advertising several open PhD studentships.  A list can be found [here](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/pg-research/funding/phdfunding/epsrc-dla-studentships/finding_a_phd_research_project/).
Around others:

A PhD studentship "*On the geometry of Rauzy fractals and their boundaries*" with Tony Samuel as main supervisor and Tanja I. Schindler as second supervisor;

A PhD studentship on "*Invariant graphs of skew product systems*" with Tanja I. Schindle as main supervisor and Peter Ashwin as second supervisor.

**Deadline for application:** February 10, 2025.

Note that these PhD studentships are different and with different topics than the ones advertised few months ago (see [here](https://www.dinamici.org/2024/10/phd-studentships-exeter-2024-10/))
